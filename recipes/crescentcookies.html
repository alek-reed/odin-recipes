        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These cookies are traditional Austrian cookies, sometimes called Viennese crescents. They're often given as Christmas gifts. Similar cookies can be found in many culinary traditions. Greek kourabiedes (a.k.a Greek wedding cookies), walnut snowballs, and Mexican wedding cookies are all crumbly, nutty, and rolled in sugar like these almond crescent cookies.</p>
